# Open Dataset Visualization Problem

## Overview

The goal of this problem is to take any publicly-available dataset, parse it, perform data transformations, and visualize the results. You are free to use any publicly available dataset and whatever data visualization tool you would like. 

**Your work should go into `src/main.py`.**

## Skills Being Tested

This is a fairly open-ended problem, but we are specifically testing your ability to:

- Call an API programmatically
- Write simple Python code to transform the results
- Use or quickly understand how to use a visualization library

## Requirements

### Data Transformation
- The transformation you need to do does not need to be incredibly complex, but should also not be immediately obvious by just looking at the dataset
- **The dataset you use must have at least 100 rows/data points**

## Example Datasets

### No Authentication Required
- [Mixed Analytics Free APIs](https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/) - No auth needed, just hit an HTTP endpoint

### Account Required
- [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/) - Need an account and `pip install kaggle`

## Example Data Visualization Tools

- **Matplotlib**: `pip install matplotlib` - [Documentation](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)
- **Seaborn**: `pip install seaborn` - [Documentation](https://pypi.org/project/seaborn/)

## Tips

- You can `pip install` whatever libraries you want in the terminal, which can be useful if the API/visualization library you want to use is available there
- **Do not be too concerned with coming up with a perfect data transformation or a perfect visualization**
- Focus on getting any visualization working within the code first
- If you have more time, feel free to do more sophisticated transformations

## Getting Started

1. Choose a dataset from the examples above or find your own
2. Set up your Python environment and install necessary libraries
3. Write code to fetch/load the data
4. Perform some basic data transformation
5. Create a visualization
6. Iterate and improve if time permits
