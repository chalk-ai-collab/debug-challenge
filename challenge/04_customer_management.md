# Customer Management Challenge

## Scenario

One of Chalk's smaller customers (representing a fraction of overall usage and revenue) has opened an unusually high number of support tickets over the past two weeks. The tickets range from legitimate configuration questions to repeated issues already addressed in documentation. You've been able to handle most of their tickets, but it's taking a lot of your time.

## Question

Walk us through how you would:

1. Communicate with the customer in a way that's supportive but sets boundaries for your bandwidth
2. Collaborate with internal teams (e.g. product, success, engineering) to determine a sustainable path forward
